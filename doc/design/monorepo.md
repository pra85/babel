# Why is Babel a monorepo?

Juggling a multimodule project over multiple repos is like trying to teach a newborn baby how to
ride a bike.

Babel follows a monorepo approach, all officially maintained modules are in the same repo.
This is quite taboo but let's look at the pros and cons:

**Pros:**

 * Single lint, build, test and release process.
 * Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
 * Single place to report issues.
 * Easier to setup a development environment.
 * Tests across modules are run together which finds bugs that touch multiple modules easier.

**Cons:**

 * Codebase looks more intimidating.
 * Repo is bigger in size.
 * ???

## This is dumb! Nobody in open source does this!

[React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages), and [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/tree/master/packages), among others, do this.
